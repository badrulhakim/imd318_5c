<h3>Question 9</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">This is the story about the student life. It gives a moral lesson to all fun-loving students who 
spend their valuable time in enjoying parties, movies, etc and not serious in studies because 
every moment of student life is valuable and time must be utilized by the students in regular 
studies . Now-a-days, students think that student life is very easy and full of fun today 
especially college life of the students. But the future of students depend upon their 
achievements in student life because the fun-loving students of today used smart ways to get 
good marks in examination</p>


<h3>Question 10</h3>
<p>WWF's mission is to stop the <strong>degradation</strong> of our planet's natural environment. </p>
